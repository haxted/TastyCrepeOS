# TastyCrepeOS
A small kernel made in Assembly (a bit of a lot), C (kernel) and C++ (bootloader)

# Installation
First, read BUILD.md. Second, grab your favorite floppy disk and `dd` the built files manually. I will make an installation program but not now.

# Usage
Just use it.

# Contributors
Me, LLVM, I, and myself.

# WARNING
Do not go into the dev branch as it is outdated.
